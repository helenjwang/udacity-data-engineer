/* We want to ask 3 questions of our data
1. Give every album in the music library that was released in a given year
select * from music_library WHERE YEAR=1970

2. Give every album in the music library that was created by a given artist
select * from artist_library WHERE artist_name="The Beatles"

3. Give all the information from the music library about a given album
select * from album_library WHERE album_name="Close To You"

Because we want to do three different queries, we will need different tables that partition the data differently.
The music library table will be partitioned by year that will become the partition key, and artist name will be the clustering column to make each Primary Key unique.
The artist library table will be partitioned by artist name that will be the partition key, and year will be the clustering column to make each Primary Key unique. More on Primary keys in the next lesson and demo.
The album library table will be partitioned by album name that will be the partition key, and artist will be the clustering colum to make each Primary Key unique. */
